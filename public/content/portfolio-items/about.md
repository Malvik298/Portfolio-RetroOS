## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a love for creating beautiful and functional web applications. My journey into code started with a simple "Hello, World!" and has grown into a full-fledged career.

With expertise in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I build modern, responsive, and performant user interfaces. This retro portfolio is a fun side project to showcase my skills in a creative way.
